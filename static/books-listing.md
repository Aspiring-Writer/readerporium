Werewolf Eveny Moore is coming into her first heat at the age of twenty-five. Bucking tradition, she chooses to go through her first heat alone instead of choosing an unmated male from her pack. There is only one male that she wants in her bed and her life: her best friend, Luke Elrich. But Luke is human and doesn’t understand the consequences of her heat-cycle, so she hides out in a safehouse, planning to ride out the cycle alone and then ask Luke to be her mate.

Luke has loved Eveny forever, but something is going on between them. He’s afraid he’s losing her forever, until she promises to talk to him after her heat-cycle is over. He overhears her brother, the pack alpha, ask another wolf to go to Eveny and take her through the heat-cycle. What her brother doesn’t know is that the male plans to invite some of his friends along. And Eveny is alone in a remote cabin, unprotected.

Alpha wolf Acksel wakes up one morning in the bed of a woman he’s had a crush on since high school. Brynn Mara was the one human who had been friendly to him in school and now, ten years later, she is snuggled up at his side, smelling like passion and sweet dreams. Even though Acksel has declared that his pack members can mate with humans from now on, he knows that any woman he takes as his mate will have a target on her back. Especially if she’s a fragile human. Deciding it’s better to cut things off than string her along when there is no hope for a relationship, he leaves without a word and ignores her.

But it doesn’t matter if Acksel acknowledges her or not, because their one night of passion has left a permanent reminder of what happens when one drunk wolf forgets protection. Angry, banished wolves from his pack discover Brynn’s secret and decide to use her against Acksel. His worst fears have come true and the only woman that ever touched his heart is now suffering because of his mistake. Can he save her in time?

This book contains one pissed-off, emotionally damaged alpha, the human woman who can tame him, and a sweet little surprise that no one expected.

Honey Williams’ alpha father has been acting strangely ever since she turned twenty-five, and as the January full moon draws near, she begins to feel like something is going to happen to her. Something bad. She takes the opportunity of her college friend’s bachelorette party to leave town, but instead of heading to her friend’s house, she runs in the opposite direction. As the full moon looms near, she knows she needs to find a place to stay so she can shift and hunt before she moves on in her attempt to get away from whatever plans her father is making for her. When she arrives in Wilde Creek two days before the full moon, she sees a small town with lots of woods to hunt in and knows she’s found a temporary place to stay. To ensure her father can’t order her home for the full moon, she disables her car, getting help from a friendly she-wolf and a handsome tow-truck driver.

When Jeremiah fakes illness to avoid the full moon preparations, he never expected to be sitting on his back porch the night of the full moon and have his life change forever. One look at the sultry beauty who shifts in his yard and he knows he’s in the presence of his mate. Honey’s father demands she return home, and the truth of his betrayal is revealed. Jeremiah is determined to keep Honey safe and keep her forever. He might not be able to shift, but he’ll be damned if he lets Honey’s life be ruined.

When a non-shifting wolf and a beautiful she-wolf get together, expect scorching sex, ripped clothes, and furniture broken in the heat of passion. Contains m/f interaction.

As the only reindeer shifter in a bear den, Dancer Grayson knows what it’s like not to fit in. When she runs into her truemate in the woods of Wilde Creek, she discovers that she fits right in with him. Adam’s not ashamed to have prey as a mate, and she’s not ashamed of his scars.

# Viking Academy by S.T. Bende

**Book 1 in a brand new series from bestselling author S.T. Bende.**

*Erik held me until my shoulders stopped shaking—whether it was a minute or an hour, I couldn’t tell. The only things I knew for sure were: (1) I was trapped a thousand years in the past, with little hope of ever going home. And, (2) I was wrapped in the arms of the most absurdly gorgeous Viking to have ever walked the face of the Earth. Maybe my old life was overrated.*

When seventeen-year-old Saga Skånstad discovers an antique dagger, she’s instantly sucked into a world where Vikings rule the seas and dragons roam the skies, and the only thing more dangerous than the chief who takes her captive is the rival who steals her away. The heir of Norway’s most feared tribe is fierce, cold, and absolutely unyielding. With intruders encroaching upon his borders, Erik Halvarsson has little patience for the girl whose ignorance threatens his very existence. He enlists Saga in the magical Valkyris Academy, where she learns the skills she’ll need to protect herself from foreign raiders and domestic terrors. But nothing can protect her from falling for the one guy in all the world she’s absolutely forbidden to choose . . . or from risking everything to unlock the secrets that haunt him.

When darkness threatens Saga’s new home, she must decide whether to return to the life she’s always known, or fight for a love she never could have imagined. Her decision will determine a legacy—not only for Saga, but for the world she never knew she was fated to lead.

# Phantom Riders MC - Hawk by Tory Richards

**Book 1 in a trilogy. No cliffhangers! Stand alone romance!**

I quickly scooted out of the booth, realizing Hawk was right behind me. Before I could question him, he grabbed my arm and proceeded to jerk me in the direction leading to the back of the bar. I glanced around the bar wildly, but I didn’t see Dane’s men anywhere.

“They left, but they’ll be back.” We entered a dark hallway and halfway down he stopped us at a door. I expected him to knock, but he lifted his leg and kicked the door in, causing the occupants in the room to scream out in fear. “Out!” he snarled.

I barely had time to acknowledge the naked couple before they snatched up their strewn about clothes and rushed past us. As the man passed me I recognized him as one of Hawk’s men. We made eye contact long enough for him to wink at me. Once they cleared the threshold, Hawk pulled me inside and slammed the door behind him.

“Take your clothes off.”

“What?”

“Take your clothes off.”

I know my jaw dropped at his demand. When I realized that he meant it I began to back up, slowly shaking my head. “You’re crazy!” I whispered sharply.

“Take your fuckin’ clothes off!” So far he hadn’t moved from his spot, yet I’d backed up until my back was against the wall. “Those men knew how to find you, which means there’s a bug on you somewhere.”

I tried to decipher what he was saying, but my brain wouldn’t wrap around the words that he thought I had a bug on me. He took a menacing step toward me, and that was all I needed to do what he wanted. Strangely, I wasn’t afraid of Hawk, only of what having his hands on me would make me feel. I was attracted to him in a strange way that left me feeling confused. Maybe it was because I knew that he wasn’t attracted to me.

I quickly removed my hoodie and handed it to him, kicking off my shoes at the same time. As Hawk began going over it, I unzipped and rolled down my jeans. I’d reached for the bottom of my t-shirt when a memory slammed into me.

“Just a minute.” I waited for him to look at me. “There’s no way there can be a bug in these clothes because they aren’t mine. I took them from a dryer in the laundromat.”

He hesitated for only a second. “I want everything.”

Deciding not to argue with him, I removed my t-shirt and threw it at him. He caught it to his chest and I swear I saw the tiniest curve of his mouth showing amusement at my irritation. He examined my clothes thoroughly, finding nothing, as I’d expected. Then he turned those dark eyes on me, running his gaze up and down my body, missing nothing.

“Everything,” he demanded. “Or did you borrow your underwear, too?”

# Strange Brew by Angela Colsin

Feeling out of touch with her magical gifts, Aislinn Carmichael is a witch seeking a means of restoring her ability to its fullest potential. Despite the warnings of family and friends, the endeavor inevitably drives her to accept the initiation trial of a witch coven called The Trine.

Their test demands the capture of a supernatural creature, a task Aislinn has little doubt she can accomplish with relative ease. But of all the potentially benign creatures she could’ve snared, none other than a feral werewolf stumbles into her trap. Making matters worse is The Trine’s intentions for her dangerous captive, forcing Aislinn to release him and potentially risk retaliation.

But vengeance is the farthest thing from the werewolf’s mind.

Troy Ashland is a werewolf standing at death’s door, slowly losing his humanity until there’s nothing left but savage instincts. It’s a process all werewolves face, and the only thing that can appease his restless beast is his mate. So when word arrives from an oracle saying to travel to the Southern US to find her, he’s on the next flight out.

After his arrival in Arkin City, the last thing Troy expects is to be caught in a magical trap. But all is forgiven with one glimpse of his temporary jailor, who turns out to be the very woman he was searching for. Still, the task of winning her is surprisingly difficult. Not only is Aislinn inexplicably resisting their attraction, but The Trine won’t leave well enough alone …

# The Final Calling by Angela Colsin

Prophecies, tyrants, assassins, and exiled royalty aren't the things Edith Walsh thought she'd be dealing with when her training as a mage apprentice began. Her main focus is becoming an enchantress by completing the Final Calling—a grand scavenger hunt all apprentices undertake to gather items needed to craft their coveted staff and gain eternal life.

This challenge can prove lethal if care isn't taken to watch one's steps. But making matters worse, Edith has also been marked for death by the Steward of the Perosian Empire, a tyrant named Rothario, all because of a pesky prophecy made centuries before her birth foretelling his demise at her hands.

So what's a mage to do? Simple; accept the assistance of a sexy Perosian who's dealt with Rothario's minions for as long as he can remember. Yet Isaac wants far more than Edith's safety—she's his mate, and his fiery gaze, wicked tongue, and shameless seductions inflame her more intensely than she's ever known.

Convicted of murdering the imperial family of Perosia, Isaac's spent centuries as a fugitive hunted by a homeland he doesn't recall. But his ruthless talent for survival serves him well, and there's nothing he won't do to protect Edith from the forces threatening her life, even if it means sacrificing his own.

# Tempting Eternity by Angela Colsin

As one of the first vampires created by the original five thousand years ago, time has taken it's toll on Mathias, weathering him until nothing seems like a surprise anymore. But even he isn't prepared for a chance encounter with a fae who proves to have a lover's blood link.

For a vampire, such a connection is a fevered, hopeless fantasy. None have blood as sweetly enticing as the fae, but they'd never survive the turning, making it imperative to resist Isadora's charms, otherwise put her very life at risk.

Yet distancing himself from the beguiling fae isn't so easy.

Nearly killed by one of her own sisters, the last thing Isadora expects to hear is that a vampire saved her life while she was vulnerable—no being poses more of a lethal threat to the fae. Even more troubling is knowing she'll have to seek his help to have any hope of saving her fae sisters from the control of a powerful witch.

But though the ancient vampire should be feared, Isadora finds Mathias compelling, pricking her innate curiosity in a way she's never experienced. Ignoring such intrigue is impossible, and the more she learns, the more quickly her feelings turn into heavy attraction, tempting her to do the impossible—spend eternity with a vampire.

# Fallen Hearts by Angela Colsin

Most humans live in blissful ignorance of the supernatural, unable to see what they don’t believe exists. Such used to be the lot of Stephan Forrester, a normal mortal leading a regular life, at least until the day vampires abducted him. With his family murdered in the attack, Stephan finds himself alone and dying of an obscure, incurable illness contracted in the vampires’ lair.

Using what time he has left to seek justice, Stephan sets out to eliminate the offenders until only one remains. However, locating this final target means doing something he doesn’t think possible—actually working with a vampire.

Entombed against her will and forced to hibernate for seventy years, Maddox only awakens when a mortal with a vendetta frees her from the grave. He needs help locating the same vampire who buried her alive, and ironically, she senses a connection to her human savior in the form of a blood link. But Stephan’s intense hatred for vampires makes honoring that link impossible.

Even so, Maddox is unlike any vampire Stephan’s ever encountered. As charming and intelligent as she is beautiful, she reminds him of what it means to actually live, mending his wounded heart. In turn, Maddox finds it hard to separate from Stephan, or resist the passionate responses he elicits, and their unexpected bond strengthens as time goes on.

But time is the one luxury Stephan doesn’t have, and saving him from his illness could prove fatal to them both.

But nobody wants to hire a brawny cyborg to do anything that doesn’t involve brutalizing people on a daily basis. Stuck working as a debt collector alongside an eccentric pilot who enjoys knitting gifts for her grandkids when she isn’t blowing people up, Jasim longs to find a more peaceful existence.

But peace is elusive when you have a violent past. While on a routine mission, Jasim comes across the body of a soldier he served with during the war. He soon learns that someone is murdering former members of the Cyborg Corps, men who should be extremely difficult to kill. And he’s next on the list.

Jasim steels himself to reach out to the one person he’s certain can help, his old commander: Colonel Leonidas Adler. Adler is strong, smart, and deadly, good traits to have in an ally. Unfortunately, he remembers Jasim as a misfit rather than a model soldier, and convincing him to join forces may be even tougher than finding and facing the killer.

# Hunter's Moon by Angela Colsin
Caleb Hodgins is a lupine known to the Arkin City Pack as an easy going wolf with a carefree attitude. But after tragedy strikes because of what he is, he's left with a painful secret and the weight of grief hanging on his shoulders. Such heartache causes Caleb to swear he'll never seek companionship with a human woman again, and it's a plan that works well enough—until Emily Sterling comes to town.

When presented with the opportunity to take a long sought job in Arkin City, Emily quickly accepts, moving halfway across the country to live next door to her childhood friend, Joslyn Santiago-Hodgins. After years of keeping in touch long distance, she finally meets the people in Joslyn's life, and finds everyone easy to fit in with—that is, everyone except Joslyn's brother-in-law, Caleb.

Emily has no idea why he's so put off by her, and his dismissive behaviors become increasingly disappointing as her attraction to him turns into undeniable interest. Yet she also doesn't realize just how quickly her fun loving attitude and playful wit draws Caleb in, reminding him of his painful secret and his drive to prevent history from repeating itself.

But a case of missing lupines sweeping the southern states may put Emily in danger simply by her unwitting association with the Arkin City Pack, giving Caleb more than one reason to protect her. In the process, the gears of bonding start to turn, and there's nothing he can do to stop it, forcing him to face his fear of revealing the truth about what he is, and risk losing Emily for good.

# The Assassin's Curse by Lindsay Buroker
When outlaws Amaranthe and Sicarius chance upon imperial spies stealing military prototypes, they immediately give chase. Well, immediately after Amaranthe talks Sicarius, former assassin and all-around non-altruistic type, into the mission. After all, they both want imperial pardons, and what better way to attract the emperor’s favor than by looking after the empire’s interests?

What seems like a straightforward mission develops a hitch when the spies flee to Darkcrest Isle, a forbidding chunk of land reputed to be haunted. Amaranthe isn’t quick to believe in tales of malevolent spirits, so she’s startled when the ever-pragmatic and unflappable Sicarius shows reluctance at setting foot on the island. Only when it may be too late to escape does Amaranthe come to understand why.

The Assassin’s Curse is a 12,000-word short story.
